# CLI UI/UX Guidelines

This document defines the visual language, interaction patterns, and composable components for Gmail Archiver's command-line interface. All commands MUST follow these guidelines to ensure a consistent, professional user experience.

**Status**: Iteration 5 - Output Consolidation & Contextual Suggestions

---

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Consistency
Same visual patterns across all commands. Users should recognize patterns from one command to another.

### 1.2 Clarity
Users always know what's happening and what to do next. Progress is visible, errors are actionable.

### 1.3 Hierarchy
Visual weight guides attention: `errors > warnings > info`. Critical information stands out.

### 1.4 Accessibility
Colors have text fallbacks. Symbols accompany colors. No meaning is conveyed through color alone.

---

## 2. Verbosity & Detail Levels

### 2.1 The `--verbose` Flag Semantic

**Core Principle**: `--verbose` shows MORE DETAIL about the SAME information, NOT different information.

| Without `--verbose` | With `--verbose` |
|---------------------|------------------|
| `✓ Imported 4,269 messages` | `✓ Imported 4,269 messages (12.3 MB, 45.2 msg/sec)` |
| `Found 15 duplicates` | `Found 15 duplicates across 3 archives` |
| `Database healthy` | `Database healthy (last vacuum: 2d ago, size: 12.4 MB)` |

**WRONG usage of `--verbose`**:
- Adding completely different categories of information
- Showing database stats when the command is about archive files
- Revealing internal implementation details

**RIGHT usage of `--verbose`**:
- Adding timing information (duration, throughput)
- Showing counts broken down by category
- Including file sizes and paths
- Displaying intermediate steps

### 2.2 Standard vs Verbose Output

Commands should include ALL essential information in standard output. Use `--verbose` only for:
- **Performance metrics**: timing, throughput, memory usage
- **Breakdown details**: counts by category, per-file statistics
- **Diagnostic context**: timestamps, paths, intermediate states

**Example: `status` command**
```
# Standard output (always shown):
Archive Statistics
  Total messages:    4,269
  Archive files:     3
  Database size:     12.4 MB
  Schema version:    1.1

# With --verbose (adds detail, same categories):
Archive Statistics
  Total messages:    4,269 (across 3 archives)
  Archive files:     3 (newest: 2d ago, oldest: 45d ago)
  Database size:     12.4 MB (last vacuum: 3d ago)
  Schema version:    1.1 (migrated from 1.0 on 2025-01-15)
```

---

## 3. Visual Language

### 3.1 Symbols & Semantics

| Symbol | Color | Meaning | Usage |
|--------|-------|---------|-------|
| `✓` | green | Success | Completed operations, passed checks |
| `✗` | red | Failure | Failed operations, errors |
| `⚠` | yellow | Warning | Non-fatal issues, caution needed |
| `ℹ` | blue | Info | Informational messages |
| `○` | dim | Pending | Not yet started |
| `⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏` | cyan | Running | Animated spinner (braille pattern) |

### 3.2 Color Semantics

| Color | Rich Markup | Semantic Meaning |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Green | `[green]` | Success, completion, passed |
| Red | `[red]` | Errors, failures, critical |
| Yellow | `[yellow]` | Warnings, caution |
| Cyan | `[cyan]` | Information, highlights |
| Blue | `[blue]` | Operations, headers |
| Dim | `[dim]` | Secondary info, metadata |

### 3.3 Typography

| Style | Rich Markup | Usage |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Bold | `[bold]` | Emphasis, headers, important values |
| Dim | `[dim]` | Secondary info, timestamps, paths |
| Normal | (none) | Primary content |

---

## 4. Message Types

### 4.1 Info Messages
Plain text, no symbol. Used for status updates and contextual information.

```
Authenticating with Gmail...
Found 1,234 messages matching query
```

**API**: `ctx.info("message")`

### 4.2 Success Messages
Green checkmark symbol. Used for completed operations.

```
✓ Authentication successful
✓ Archive validation passed
```

**API**: `ctx.success("message")`

### 4.3 Warning Messages
Yellow warning symbol. Used for non-fatal issues.

```
⚠ DRY RUN - no changes made
⚠ Some messages could not be processed
```

**API**: `ctx.warning("message")`

### 4.4 Error Messages
Red text with optional suggestion. Used for errors that don't require a panel.

```
Error: File not found
Suggestion: Check the file path and try again
```

**API**: `ctx.error("message", suggestion="optional suggestion")`

### 4.5 Success Message Consolidation

**Principle**: Each successful phase should have ONE success indicator, not multiple.

**Anti-pattern (redundant):**
```
✓ Validating archive: Passed all checks
╭── Validation Panel ──╮
│ ✓ Check 1: PASSED    │
│ ✓ Check 2: PASSED    │
│ ✓ VALIDATION PASSED  │  ← Redundant inside panel
╰──────────────────────╯
✓ Archive validation passed    ← Redundant after panel
✓ Archive completed!           ← Third success message
```

**Better pattern:**
```
✓ Validating archive: Passed 4/4 checks

📦 Archive Summary
   Messages: 42
   File: archive.mbox
   Size: 12.3 MB

✓ Archive completed!
```

**Rules:**
- Panel content should NOT repeat the panel title's status
- After showing a detailed panel, don't add a standalone success message repeating the same info
- One final "completed" message per command is sufficient

---

## 5. Panel Components

*[Placeholder - Iteration 2]*

### 5.1 Error Panel
When: Fatal errors requiring user attention.

### 5.2 Validation Panel
When: Multi-check validation results.

### 5.3 When to Use Panels
- **USE**: Final results, errors requiring attention, multi-item summaries
- **DON'T USE**: Progress updates, simple confirmations, inline status

### 5.4 Validation Display Design

Validation output adapts based on mode and outcome:

**Normal mode: Task completion only (no panel)**
```
✓ Validating archive: Passed 4/4 checks
```

**With --verbose: Detailed panel explaining each check**
```
✓ Validating archive: Passed 4/4 checks

╭── Validation Details ──────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ ✓ Count check       Verified 19,334 messages exist in mbox file   │
│ ✓ Database check    All message IDs in database found in archive  │
│ ✓ Integrity check   SHA256 checksums match for all messages       │
│ ✓ Spot check        Random sample of 10 messages fully readable   │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

**With failures (always show panel, even without --verbose):**
```
✗ Validating archive: Failed 1/4 checks

╭── Validation Details ──────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ ✓ Count check       Verified 19,334 messages exist in mbox file   │
│ ✗ Database check    5 message IDs missing from archive            │
│ ✓ Integrity check   SHA256 checksums match for all messages       │
│ ○ Spot check        Skipped (previous check failed)               │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

**Principle**: `--verbose` adds MORE INFORMATION about what each check does, not just different formatting.

**Check explanations for --verbose:**
| Check | Description shown in verbose |
|-------|------------------------------|
| Count | "Verified N messages exist in mbox file" |
| Database | "All message IDs in database found in archive" or details on mismatches |
| Integrity | "SHA256 checksums match for all messages" |
| Spot check | "Random sample of N messages fully readable" |

---

## 6. Tables & Reports

*[Placeholder - Iteration 3]*

### 6.1 Key-Value Report
For summary data with labels and values.

### 6.2 Tabular Data
For multi-row data with headers.

### 6.3 Command Summary Layout

Final summaries should be visually scannable with strategic emoji for engagement:

```
📦 Archive Summary
   Archived     42 messages
   Skipped      10 duplicates
   File         archive_20251201.mbox
   Size         2.3 GB
   Gmail        Moved to trash (30-day recovery)

✓ Archive completed!

💡 Suggestions:
   • Permanently delete from Gmail: gmailarchiver retry-delete archive_20251201.mbox --permanent
```

**Strategic emoji usage:**
| Context | Emoji | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Archive/Storage | 📦 | 📦 Archive Summary |
| Suggestions | 💡 | 💡 Suggestions: |
| Warning context | ⚠️ | Used in warning panels |
| Time/Duration | ⏱️ | ⏱️ Duration: 5m 23s |
| Size/Space | 💾 | 💾 Size: 2.3 GB |

**Note**: Emojis are optional enhancements for section headers. The UI must work without them. Core status symbols (✓/✗/⚠/ℹ) remain unchanged.

---

## 7. Progress & Tasks

### 7.1 Spinner (Indeterminate Progress)
Used when total is unknown. Animated braille pattern spinner.

```
⠹ Loading messages...
⠸ Authenticating with Gmail...
```

### 7.2 Progress Bar (Determinate Progress)
Used when total is known. Shows percentage, count, and ETA.

```
⠹ Importing messages [████████░░░░] 67% • 1,234/2,000 • 2m remaining
```

### 7.2.1 Spinner vs Progress Bar Decision

**RULE**: When the total count is known AND the operation involves network/slow I/O, **always use progress bar**.

| Scenario | Total Known? | Slow I/O? | Use |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-----|
| Authenticating with Gmail | No | Yes | Spinner |
| Scanning messages (discovery) | No | Yes | Spinner with live counter |
| Moving messages to trash | **Yes** | Yes | **Progress bar** |
| Permanently deleting messages | **Yes** | Yes | **Progress bar** |
| Importing messages from mbox | **Yes** | No (local) | Progress bar |
| Compressing archive | No | Yes | Spinner |

**Rationale**: For slow operations with known duration, users need feedback that the operation is progressing. A spinner doesn't convey how much work remains, which causes anxiety during long waits.

**API Pattern for Network Operations with Progress**:
```python
with seq.task("Moving to trash", total=len(message_ids)) as task:
    def on_progress(count: int) -> None:
        task.advance(count - last_count)

    await client.trash_messages(message_ids, progress_callback=on_progress)
    task.complete(f"{len(message_ids):,} messages processed")
```

### 7.3 Task Sequence (Issue #4 Pattern)
Used for multi-step operations. Each task shows spinner while running, then checkmark/X when complete.

**Running State:**
```
✓ Counting messages: Found 4,269 messages
⠹ Importing messages...
```

**Completed (Success):**
```
✓ Counting messages: Found 4,269 messages
✓ Importing messages: Imported 4,269 messages
✓ Verifying import: All messages valid
```

**Completed (Failure):**
```
✓ Counting messages: Found 4,269 messages
✗ Importing messages: FAILED → "Database write error"
```

**API (Fluent Builder):**
```python
with ctx.ui.task_sequence() as seq:
    with seq.task("Counting messages") as t:
        count = importer.count_messages(file)
        t.complete(f"Found {count:,} messages")

    with seq.task("Importing messages", total=count) as t:
        for msg in messages:
            process(msg)
            t.advance()
        t.complete(f"Imported {count:,} messages")
```

**Task Handle Methods:**
- `t.complete(message)` - Mark task as successful (shows ✓)
- `t.fail(message, reason=None)` - Mark task as failed (shows ✗)
- `t.advance(n=1)` - Advance progress counter (if total was set)
- `t.set_total(total)` - Set total after task started (for late-bound totals)
- `t.set_status(text)` - Update task description (e.g., for live counters)
- `t.log(message, level)` - Log a message within the task

### 7.4 Log Window (Streaming Tasks)
For operations with streaming output, use `show_logs=True` to display a scrolling log window below the tasks.

**Archive Command Example:**
```
✓ Scanning messages from Gmail: Found 15,000 messages
✓ Checking for already archived: Identified 13,267 to archive (1,733 already archived)
⠹ Archiving messages [████░░░░░░░░] 30% • 3,980/13,267
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✓ Archived: RE: Q4 Budget Review
✓ Archived: Meeting Notes - Product Sync
✓ Archived: Invoice #12345
⚠ Skipped (duplicate): FW: Contract Update
```

**API:**
```python
with ctx.ui.task_sequence(show_logs=True) as seq:
    # Task 1: Discovery (spinner with live counter)
    with seq.task("Scanning messages from Gmail") as t:
        def progress(count, page):
            t.set_status(f"Scanning messages from Gmail... {count:,} found")
        messages = client.list_messages(query, progress_callback=progress)
        t.complete(f"Found {len(messages):,} messages")

    # Task 2: Filtering (quick)
    with seq.task("Checking for already archived") as t:
        to_archive, skipped = filter_archived(messages)
        t.complete(f"Identified {len(to_archive):,} to archive")

    # Task 3: Archiving (progress bar + log window)
    with seq.task("Archiving messages", total=len(to_archive)) as t:
        for msg in archive(to_archive):
            t.log(f"Archived: {msg.subject}", "SUCCESS")
            t.advance()
        t.complete(f"Archived {len(to_archive):,} messages")
```

**Log Symbols:**
| Level | Symbol | Color |
|-------|--------|-------|
| INFO | ℹ | blue |
| WARNING | ⚠ | yellow |
| ERROR | ✗ | red |
| SUCCESS | ✓ | green |

### 7.5 Authentication (Spinner Pattern)
Gmail authentication uses the spinner pattern for consistent UI across all commands.

**Running State:**
```
⠹ Authenticating with Gmail...
```

**Completed (Success):**
```
✓ Authenticating with Gmail: Connected
```

**Completed (Failure):**
```
✗ Authenticating with Gmail: Authentication failed
```

**API:**
```python
# Required authentication (exits on failure)
gmail = ctx.authenticate_gmail(credentials=credentials)

# Optional authentication (returns None on failure)
gmail = ctx.authenticate_gmail(required=False)
if gmail is None:
    ctx.warning("Continuing without Gmail access")

# With deletion permission validation
gmail = ctx.authenticate_gmail(validate_deletion_scope=True)
```

**Method Signature:**
```python
def authenticate_gmail(
    self,
    credentials: str | None = None,      # Custom OAuth2 credentials file
    required: bool = True,                # Exit on failure if True
    validate_deletion_scope: bool = False # Check deletion permission
) -> GmailClient | None
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Uses `ctx.ui.spinner()` internally for consistent UI
- Automatically sets `ctx.gmail` on success
- Handles all error cases with proper error panels
- Supports both `@with_context(requires_gmail=True)` and manual calls

### 7.6 Multi-Phase Operations with Different Checks

When operations have multiple filtering phases with different semantics:
- **Combine semantically related checks** where possible to avoid user confusion
- **If checks must be separate**, make the distinction clear in task names
- **Exit early** when no work remains rather than proceeding with empty batches

**Anti-pattern (confusing):**
```
✓ Phase 1 check: 10 items to process
✓ Phase 2: Processed 0 items (10 filtered)
```
User expects 10 items to be processed, but all are filtered in Phase 2.

**Better pattern:**
```
✓ Checking items: 10 found, all already processed
ℹ Nothing to do
```

**Archive command example:**
```
# Bad: Messages pass Phase 1 but all filtered in Phase 2
✓ Checking for already archived: 10 to archive (19,324 already archived)
✓ Archiving messages: No messages archived
⚠ Skipped (duplicate): [10 messages listed]

# Good: All filtering combined, early exit
✓ Checking for already archived: 19,324 archived, 10 duplicates
ℹ Nothing to archive - all messages already in archive
```

---

## 8. Suggestions & Next Steps

### 8.1 Wording

Use "Suggestions:" or "You might want to:" instead of "Next steps:" which implies mandatory actions.

**Anti-pattern:**
```
Next steps:
  1. Check archive status: gmailarchiver status
  2. Verify integrity: gmailarchiver verify-integrity
```

**Better:**
```
💡 Suggestions:
   • Check archive status: gmailarchiver status
   • Verify integrity: gmailarchiver verify-integrity
```

Or with context:
```
💡 Since 10 duplicates were skipped, you might want to:
   • Review duplicates: gmailarchiver dedupe --dry-run
```

### 8.2 Contextual Suggestions

Suggestions should be contextual to what happened:

| Outcome | Suggestion |
|---------|------------|
| **0 messages archived** | Don't suggest "check status" - nothing changed |
| **Messages archived successfully** | Suggest verification or permanent deletion |
| **Duplicates found** | Suggest dedupe review |
| **Validation passed (with --trash)** | Suggest permanent deletion |
| **Errors occurred** | Suggest retry or repair commands |

**Examples:**

```
# After successful archive with --trash
💡 Suggestions:
   • Permanently delete from Gmail: gmailarchiver retry-delete archive.mbox --permanent

# After archive found all duplicates
💡 Since all messages were duplicates, you might want to:
   • Review your archives: gmailarchiver status
   • Check for duplicate cleanup: gmailarchiver dedupe --dry-run

# After validation failure
💡 To fix the issues:
   • Run repair: gmailarchiver repair --archive archive.mbox
   • Re-validate: gmailarchiver validate archive.mbox
```

### 8.3 Suggestion Styling

**API**: `ctx.show_suggestions(suggestions, context=None)`

```python
# Simple suggestions list
ctx.show_suggestions([
    "Check archive status: gmailarchiver status",
    "Verify integrity: gmailarchiver verify-integrity"
])

# With contextual header
ctx.show_suggestions(
    suggestions=["Review duplicates: gmailarchiver dedupe --dry-run"],
    context="Since 10 duplicates were skipped"
)
```

---

## 9. JSON Mode

All output MUST have a JSON equivalent for automation. When `--json` flag is used:

```json
{
  "events": [
    {"event": "task_start", "description": "Counting messages", "timestamp": 1234567890.123},
    {"event": "task_complete", "description": "Counting messages", "success": true, "result": "Found 4,269 messages"},
    {"event": "task_start", "description": "Importing messages", "total": 4269},
    {"event": "progress", "completed": 100, "total": 4269},
    {"event": "task_complete", "description": "Importing messages", "success": true, "result": "Imported 4,269 messages"}
  ],
  "timestamp": 1234567890.999,
  "success": true,
  "status": "ok"
}
```

---

## 10. Accessibility

### 10.1 Color Independence
- **NEVER** convey meaning through color alone
- **ALWAYS** pair colors with symbols (✓/✗/⚠)
- Text labels accompany all status indicators

### 10.2 Non-TTY Environments
- Graceful degradation when no terminal detected
- Plain text fallback without Rich formatting
- JSON mode (`--json`) for piping and automation

### 10.3 Screen Reader Considerations
- Meaningful text descriptions (not just symbols)
- Avoid ASCII art that doesn't linearize well
- Progress updates at reasonable intervals (not every item)

---

## 11. Error Recovery Patterns

*[Placeholder - Iteration 4]*

### 11.1 Retryable Errors
### 11.2 Partial Success
### 11.3 Rollback Scenarios
### 11.4 Graceful Interruption (Ctrl+C)

---

## 12. Component Composition Rules

- **One live context at a time**: No nested progress bars or task sequences
- **Task sequences contain tasks**: Not other sequences (flat structure)
- **Panels appear after progress**: Never show bordered panels during live progress
- **JSON events are real-time**: Emit events as they happen, don't buffer

---

| `doctor` | ✓ Iteration 4 | task_sequence (diagnostic + auto-fix) |
| (other commands) | Pending | See implementation plan |

### A.3 Authentication Pattern Usage

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `ctx.authenticate_gmail()` | Required auth, exits on failure |
| `ctx.authenticate_gmail(required=False)` | Optional auth (e.g., import command) |
| `ctx.authenticate_gmail(validate_deletion_scope=True)` | Auth + deletion permission check |
| `@with_context(requires_gmail=True)` | Decorator-level auth for entire command |
